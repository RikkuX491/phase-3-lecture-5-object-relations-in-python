## Lecture Topics

- Object Relations in Python
- One-to-many

In today's lecture, we will discuss about Object Relations in Python. We will discuss relationships of tables in a relational database and will use Python classes as representations of tables from a relational database.

## Setup

1. Make sure that your current working directory (folder) contains a `Pipfile`, then run `pipenv install` in your terminal to install `pytest` and any other required libraries.
2. Now that your `pipenv` virtual environment is ready to use, enter `pipenv shell` to start working.
